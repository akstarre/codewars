# CodeWars Challenges by Kyle Starrett 🚀

![CodeWars Rank](https://www.codewars.com/users/akstarre/badges/large)

Welcome to my dedicated repository where I document my journey of solving CodeWars challenges daily. Through these challenges, I hone my problem-solving skills, learn new techniques, and demonstrate my fluency in code.

## 🎯 Motivation

Coding is as much an art as it is a science. By committing to these challenges daily, I aim to:

1. **Hone My Skills**: Practice makes perfect. Regular coding exercises help me improve my coding efficiency and algorithmic thinking.
2. **Learn Continuously**: With each challenge, I discover new methods, algorithms, and best practices.
3. **Share Knowledge**: This repository is not just a testament to my dedication but also a resource for others looking to learn and improve.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **Daily Challenges**: Each directory corresponds to a date and contains solutions for challenges I tackled that day.

## 🌱 How I Approach Challenges

1. **Understand the Problem**: Before diving into the code, I ensure I understand the problem statement, constraints, and expected outcomes.
2. **Plan**: I chalk out a plan, be it an algorithm, pseudocode, or a simple list of steps.
3. **Code**: I then convert the plan into executable code, ensuring it's clean and readable.
4. **Test & Refactor**: After achieving a working solution, I test edge cases and refactor for efficiency and readability.

## 🤝 Contributing & Feedback

While this repository primarily serves as a personal record, feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always appreciated. If you have any alternative solutions or optimizations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
